Hey,
Please run java swing animation a couple of times  because swing becomes buggy. If buggy please close swing and run it again. 


More specifically, there is supposed to be a column of chess board tiles on each piece's path. The pieces 
	themselves always seem to work, but more often than not, the tiles are not displayed. The cause of this 
	is still unknown.
